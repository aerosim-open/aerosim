# AeroSim Assets Documentation

In the AeroSim project, we rely on a wide range of 3D assets to build immersive and accurate simulation environments. These assets include aerial and ground vehicles, dynamic agents, and environment components designed to support diverse urban air mobility (UAM) scenarios.

Each asset section below includes:
- A brief description
- Visual previews from Unreal Engine and Omniverse
- Direct GitHub links to:
  - Unreal Engine `.uasset` files, materials, and textures
  - Omniverse `.usdc` files with materials and corresponding `.blend` source files
